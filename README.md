# DigiClock
DigiClock is a stylish digital clock web app that displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM. It updates every second using JavaScript and has a clean, glowing UI design.

##  What I Learned
- Connecting HTML elements with JavaScript using `getElementById`
- Using `setTimeout` to update time every second
- Formatting time with leading zeros
- Basic time logic (AM/PM and 12-hour conversion)

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Done!
